This is a website where we have connected the JSON Power Database base using the post requets menthod in the form in order to put in the data to perform different types of the operations on the database.
A database server providing developer-friendly REST API services is JsonPowerDB. It is a Real-time Database that is High Performance, Lightweight, Ajax Enabled, Serverless, and Easy to Use.

Without the need to install any databases or use any server side programming or scripting, database apps may be created quickly and easily.

Developing a dynamic website, a mobile app, or some sort of data analytics portal is really enjoyable and quick. There is nothing superior to doing it yourself. All you require is a fundamental knowledge of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Javascript.
